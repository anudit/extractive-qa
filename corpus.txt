  SCHEME OF ASSISTANCE TO DISABLED PERSONS FOR 
PURCHASE/FITTING OF AIDS/APPLIANCES (ADIP SCHEME)  
  
1.0        INTRODUCTION  
  
Provision of suitable aids and assistive devices  is one of the first steps in 
the process of rehabilitation of Persons with Disabilities (PwDs).   It has been 
the constant endeavour of the Government to provide PwDs with aids and 
assistive devices, which ar e essential for their overall rehabilitation and 
empowerment. As per Census, 2011 there are 2.68 crore PwDs in the country. 
In addition, a large number of children below 14 years of age suffer from 
delayed development. Many of them suffer from intellectual  disabilities and 
cerebral palsy and require aids/appliances to attain the capacity for self -care 
and independent living. With the application of modern technology, a number 
of aids have emerged which can reduce the effects of disabilities and enhance 
the overall potential of the PwDs. However, a large proportion of PwDs are from 
the low income group and are deprived of the benefits of these appliances 
because of their inability to garner funds to acquire these and consequently live 
a dignified life.  
  
1.01.   In the light of the Government’s commitment for enabling and 
empowering PwDs, it has been decided to continue the scheme in a modified 
form by enhancing the quantum of assistance, cost, ceiling of aids   and 
assistive device s and family income ceilin g taking into consideration the cost 
escalation during the period these monetary limits have not been revised. In 
addition, the modified scheme in terms of coverage of beneficiaries and more 
users  friendly.
